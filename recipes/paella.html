    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Originating in the Valencia region, paella is a saffron-infused rice dish cooked in a large, shallow pan. The classic Valencian version is made with chicken, rabbit, and green beans, but seafood paella (paella de marisco) and mixed paella are also very popular. </p>
